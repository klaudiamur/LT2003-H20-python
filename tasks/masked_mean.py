    """
    given a 4D matrix A and a 3D mask B return a 3D matrix C where the third and last dimension 
    is the average over the third dimension in 4D.

    lets say we have a matrix where with the dims are (NR DOCUMENTS, NR SENTENCE, NR WORDS, WORD FEATURE DIM), 
    (WORD FEATURE DIM is the length of the feature vectors we use to represent words)

    example:
    M = [
        [[w1,w2,pad,pad],[w1,w2,w3,pad]],
        [[w1,pad,pad,pad],[w1,w2,pad,pad]],
        ...
        [[w1,w2,pad,pad],[w1,w2,w3,pad]],
        ]
    NOTE! wn here is a vector.

    we would then have a mask where mask[0] == [[1,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0]]. So, our mask signifies which words in each 
    document that are pads or actual words.

    What we want to do is average M and create M2. M2 should contained vectors of sentences representations
    instead of a 2D matrix of word features e.g:

    M2 = [
        [sent1,sent2],
        [sent1,sent2],
        ...
        [sent1,sent2],
        ]
    where sentn is a vector

    when we are averaging we dont want to include the padding tokens hence we can use the mask to make 
    sure we are averaging correctly.

    restrictions
    1) you are not allowed to use any loops instead you are suppose to use matrix operations

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    A1 = np.mean(matrix, axis = 3)
    
    M2 = np.multiply(A1, mask)

    return M2
    
    
    pass
